# TODO.md - GraphQL Server in Go 

## 1. Define Basic Schema
- [ ] **Define types and fields**
    - Create GraphQL types (`User`, `Post`, `Comment`, etc.) with appropriate fields (`ID`, `name`, `email`, etc.).
    - Define relationships between types (e.g., `User` can have multiple `Posts`).
- [ ] **Define queries**
    - Create `Query` type with fields to fetch data (e.g., `users`, `user(id: ID)`, `posts`, `post(id: ID)`).
- [ ] **Define mutations**
    - Create `Mutation` type to handle data modification (e.g., `createUser`, `updateUser`, `deleteUser`).

## 2. Create Go Structs for Types
- [ ] **Map GraphQL types to Go structs**
    - Implement Go structs representing the data models (e.g., `User`, `Post`).
    - Ensure the structs match the GraphQL types in terms of fields.

## 3. Build Resolvers
- [ ] **Write resolvers for queries**
    - Implement the logic for resolving query fields, such as fetching users or posts from a database or an in-memory data structure.
- [ ] **Write resolvers for mutations**
    - Implement the logic for modifying data (e.g., adding or updating users, posts).
- [ ] **Add error handling to resolvers**
    - Ensure proper error handling and return meaningful error messages in the response.

## 4. Implement Schema and Resolver Logic
- [ ] **Create GraphQL schema**
    - Use `graphql.NewObject` to create the schema objects (`Query`, `Mutation`).
- [ ] **Connect resolvers to schema**
    - Use `graphql.Field` to connect the resolvers to the schema's query and mutation fields.

## 5. Set Up HTTP Server
- [ ] **Create a simple HTTP server**
    - Use `net/http` to set up the server.
    - Define a route for `/graphql` that will handle POST requests.
- [ ] **Handle GraphQL queries**
    - Create a function to parse incoming GraphQL queries and execute them using the schema and resolvers.
- [ ] **Handle JSON response**
    - Return the query result as JSON with the appropriate status code.

## 6. Add Validation
- [ ] **Validate GraphQL queries**
    - Implement validation for the incoming GraphQL query string (e.g., check for syntax errors or invalid fields).
- [ ] **Validate arguments for queries and mutations**
    - Add argument validation for queries (e.g., ensure `id` is present for fetching a specific user).

## 7. Integrate with a Database
- [ ] **Choose a database**
    - Decide whether you will use a SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB).
- [ ] **Connect to the database**
    - Implement a database connection using Goâ€™s database libraries (e.g., `database/sql` or MongoDB's Go driver).
- [ ] **Modify resolvers to interact with the database**
    - Update the resolvers to interact with the database instead of using in-memory data.
- [ ] **Create data models and migrations**
    - Create Go structs that map to database tables/collections.
    - Implement database migrations to set up the necessary schema.

## 8. Implement Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] **Add JWT authentication**
    - Implement JWT-based authentication for secure access to the GraphQL API.
- [ ] **Secure mutation endpoints**
    - Ensure that only authorized users can execute certain mutations (e.g., only admin can delete users).
- [ ] **Add role-based access control (RBAC)**
    - Implement role-based permissions to limit access to specific fields or mutations.

## 9. Add Pagination and Filtering
- [ ] **Implement pagination**
    - Allow the `users` query to support pagination (e.g., `limit`, `offset`).
- [ ] **Implement filtering**
    - Add filtering capabilities to the `users` and `posts` queries (e.g., filter by name or email).

## 10. Add Subscriptions (Optional)
- [ ] **Set up WebSockets**
    - Implement WebSocket support to handle GraphQL subscriptions.
- [ ] **Create subscription types**
    - Implement subscriptions for real-time updates (e.g., new user created, post updated).

## 11. Optimize Performance
- [ ] **Batch database queries**
    - Use techniques like batch loading to avoid N+1 query problems when resolving related data.
- [ ] **Add caching**
    - Implement caching for frequent queries to reduce database load (e.g., cache user data).
- [ ] **Implement request logging and monitoring**
    - Add logging and monitoring for performance tracking (e.g., use `logrus` or integrate with a service like Prometheus).

## 12. Add Tests
- [ ] **Write unit tests for resolvers**
    - Write tests to ensure resolvers are working correctly with mock data.
- [ ] **Write integration tests**
    - Write integration tests to test the entire GraphQL endpoint with actual requests and responses.
- [ ] **Write tests for mutations**
    - Ensure mutations are properly tested for creating, updating, and deleting data.

## 13. Documentation
- [ ] **Document schema in `README.md`**
    - Provide documentation for the GraphQL schema, including the available queries and mutations.
- [ ] **Document API usage**
    - Explain how to use the server, including sample GraphQL queries.
- [ ] **Document authentication flow**
    - Provide documentation for using JWT authentication and acquiring a token.
