# graph-ql-server
A custom implementation of a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) server built using Go

A lightweight, custom-built [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) server implemented in Go from scratch. It features a manually defined schema, query resolvers, and an HTTP server to process [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) requests. The server includes basic user management with the ability to query users by ID and fetch all users. It serves as a foundation for extending with mutations, authentication, database integration, and real-time subscriptions.
